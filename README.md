## About the Development
SpaceRift is developed by [NorthWestTrees Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/c/NorthWestTreesGaming). All assets are made with free software such as [Paint Dot Net](https://www.getpaint.net/) and [BlockBench](https://www.blockbench.net/), the actuall mod is made using [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/). The modification has been a work in progress since 2021. The first snapshot was released on June 18th, 2022 on MCreator's website.

## About the Minecraft modification
SpaceRift will be a exploration mod with many new biomes and dimensions to explore, new blocks to build with, new mechanics, and many advanced features that would be impossible for most MCreator creators to do. Some advanced things already in the modification can be seen with the portal system and how saberfish glow with actual light. Many more things and advanced systems are planned in upcoming snapshots as I work towards a official release.
