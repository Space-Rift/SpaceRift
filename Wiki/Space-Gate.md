# Wiki: Space Gate
## Building the Space Gate
You will need one block of obsidian and one diamond item. Once you have those two items find a suitable location to create the space gate. When placing your obsidian block make sure there is room for at least two blocks around the obsidian for the portal blocks.  
If you build the portal and there are blocks in the way they should break and drop the item in some cases.  
  
Once you have placed your obsidian right-click the obsidian with the diamond. The diamond will be removed from your inventory and the portal will generate it. The generation level of the portal will be at the same level as the obsidian block.

## Build limit
The portal will be generated at the same position in the world you create the portal at. This can be an issue with the latest 1.18 build height expansion, the Nether and End still use 256 for the maximum build height so its best to make your portal around this build limit so you have a platform to spawn on.

## Gatekey Books
You can find Gatekey Books in ruins located in deserts, jungles, and swamps. Thes books once right-clicked will generate a random world and its gatekey combonation. If you right-click on the book again it will save the key numbers to your portal history section on the first line while moving all other history down by one.

## Random world keys
Each save generates a random series of numbers similar to '12-34-56-78" the values of each number sequence range from 10 to 99 and are procedurly generated randomly. Each world is double checked to ensure the keys don't exist before setting the gate key to that world.

## Using the portal
To use the portal you will first need to enter the portal key to the blocks memory. To do this simply right-click on the portal without sneaking and a screen will pop up. In this screen you will need to add the portal key numbers similar to this value "12-34-56-78" in the text field. Once you have done this press "Enter" This will save the key to the interface block.

The next step is to right-click the interface while snaking to teleport to the world that you have inputed using the key for that world. It may take a few seconds to teleport you and any entities near the portal gate pad to the world of your choice.

## Planned Features
- Teleportation between Space Gates in the same world.
